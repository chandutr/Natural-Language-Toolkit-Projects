# Natural-Language-Toolkit-Projects
This repository contains **different sets of Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) projects**, each organized in its own folder.

- ðŸ“„ **.ipynb files** â€“ Python code implementing various NLTK techniques such as tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, partâ€‘ofâ€‘speech tagging, named entity recognition, and text classification.
